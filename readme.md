# What is Devops ?
* it is a  process of improving the application delivery by ensuring 
    * proper automation
    * application quality
    * continous monitoring or observability
    * continous testing
* These are the ```4 pillers of Devops```

### Why Devops ?

* Develepor writes code which is available in a central location (GitHub) 
* System administrator creates a server where the application is deployed by the BRE
* when the app is deployed the tester tests it.
* After testing BRE {Build and release engineer} promotes the application into production or pre-production
* In short before 10 years, for delivering an application to the  customer there were 3 job roles
    * System admin
    * BRE
    * Server Admin
* There must be an application server on the server created by system admin.Server admin creates that
* Manual effort was made and hence there was a delay in delivering the application
* So to automate this Devops came into picture
